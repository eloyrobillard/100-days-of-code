# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Working out debounced text search in React. Also, first time using NextJS.

**Thoughts** I'm not used enough to using useCallback/useMemo. But at least it's clearer how they help solve re-render issues.

### Day 2: December 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Created DB in Supabase, and sent pokemons through with Prisma.

**TODO**: 
- API in Next
- Auth

**Thoughts**: I'm still unclear on how the whole FE+BE Next stuff will unwrap. looking forward to tomorrow.
